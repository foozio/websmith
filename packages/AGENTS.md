# Packages Workspace Guide

## Mission
Oversee all publishable libraries inside `packages`. Each subdirectory has its own AGENTS.md—consult those before editing.

## Structure Overview
- `websmith-ui` – React component library exposed to consumers.
- `websmith-theme` – Tailwind configuration/extensions consumed by apps.
- `websmith-tokens` – Design tokens source of truth with multi-target builds.
- `websmith-cli` – Developer tooling and scaffolding scripts.
- `websmith-eslint` – ESLint rules for Websmith Kit patterns and best practices.
- `websmith-vscode` – VS Code extension for enhanced developer experience.

## Shared Practices
- Source lives in `src/`; `dist/` is generated by `tsup` and must not be edited.
- Respect the root TypeScript config via `tsconfig.base.json` and local `tsconfig.json` paths.
- Every publish-impacting change requires `npx changeset`.

## Commands
- `npm run build -- --filter=packages/...` to compile a specific package.
- `npm run test -- --filter=packages/websmith-ui` when component changes include tests.
- `npm run lint -- --filter=packages/...` for targeted linting.

## Release Readiness
- Update each package’s `CHANGELOG.md` through Changesets, never by hand.
- Ensure exported typings stay in sync with implementation.
- Verify local linking by re-installing `node_modules` after major dependency bumps.
